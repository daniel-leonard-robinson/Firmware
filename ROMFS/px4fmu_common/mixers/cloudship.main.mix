Stabilator/thruster/rudder mixer for PX4FMU
=======================================================

This file defines mixers suitable for controlling an airship with
stabilator, rudder rotor, starboard and port thruster using PX4FMU.
The configuration assumes the stabilator servo is connected to PX4FMU servo
output 0, starboard thruster to output 1, port thruster to output 2, and the
rudder rotor to output 3.

Inputs to the mixer come from channel group 0 (vehicle attitude), channels 0
(roll), 1 (pitch), 2 (yaw) and 3 (thrust) 4 (flaps).

Servo controlling stabilator mixer
------------
Two scalers total (output, thrust angle).

This mixer assumes that the stabilator servo is set up correctly mechanically;
depending on the actual configuration it may be necessary to reverse the scaling
factors (to reverse the servo movement) and adjust the offset, scaling and
endpoints to suit.

Starboard and port thruster mixer
-----------------
Two scalers total (output, thrust).

By default mixer output is normalized. In the case of certain input controllers
the commented lines generate a full-range output (-1 to 1) from an input in the
(0 - 1) range. Inputs below zero are treated as zero.

Rudder rotor mixer
------------
Two scalers total (output, yaw).

This mixer assumes that the rudder rotor is set up correctly mechanically;
depending on the actual configuration it may be necessary to reverse the scaling
factors (to reverse the motor movement) and adjust the offset, scaling and
endpoints to suit.
